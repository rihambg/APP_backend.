# Python Server Overview

This project contains a Python-based backend server. It is designed to handle API requests and provide necessary backend functionality for the application.

## How to Start the Server

1. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**  
    It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies. Create and activate a virtual environment using:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**  
    Ensure you have Python installed. Install the required dependencies using:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Server**  
    Start the server by running:
    ```bash
    python server.py
    ```

4. **Access the Server**  
    By default, the server will run on `http://localhost:5000`. You can configure the port in the `server.py` file if needed.

## Notes
- Ensure all environment variables are properly set if required.
- Check the `logs/` directory for server logs in case of issues.
- Refer to the `config/` folder for additional configuration options.
